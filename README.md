*Note: -*

A bit more progress has been made in this course. However, I was still learning new topics. Don't expect amazing code or something...

I felt a bit better about my coding skills here, though there were some parts I was still kind of struggling with. But, thankfully everything turned out good.

*Disclaimer: -*

This is what my university's professors and lab instructors have taught us at the American University of Sharjah (AUS).

All credit is given to them and their work that they have provided for their students.

I did not create all the codes on my own for all assignments, I mearly had to complete a portion of the code (like a function or something else) that were provided or fully write the entire code (typically the shorter codes were probably mine).

(I guess you can consider this as a reference...)
